# Spotify Visualizer

A beautiful, interactive music visualizer that creates dynamic particle effects synchronized to your Spotify music, with colors sampled from album artwork and customizable background gradients.

## üéØ Project Overview & Design Philosophy

This visualizer was designed with several core principles in mind:

### **Aesthetic Intention**
The goal was to create a visual experience that complements music rather than overwhelming it. The particle system uses bokeh-style rendering (inspired by camera lens blur effects) to create soft, dreamy orbs that float and dance with the music. The particles sample colors directly from album artwork, creating a cohesive visual theme that changes with each song.

### **Technical Approach**
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks or heavy dependencies - just clean, efficient code
- **Canvas 2D API**: Chosen for broad compatibility and smooth performance
- **Real-time Audio Analysis**: Uses Web Audio API to create truly reactive visuals
- **Color Science**: K-means clustering algorithm extracts dominant colors from album art

### **User Experience**
- **Minimalist Interface**: All controls hidden by default for an immersive experience
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick access to fullscreen (F) and settings (right-click)
- **Persistent Configuration**: Your perfect settings saved automatically
- **Screen Audio Capture**: Works with headphones by capturing browser tab audio

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Can't connect to Spotify"
- Ensure you've added the correct redirect URI to your Spotify app
- Check that your Client ID is correctly set in `auth.js`

### "No audio detected"
- Try screen capture instead of microphone
- Ensure Spotify is playing in a browser tab
- Check browser permissions for audio access

### "Particles not moving"
- Enable audio capture first
- Try adjusting particle speed settings
- Check that audio levels are showing in the debug panel

### "Background not changing"
- Ensure Canvas Blend Mode is set to "Normal" initially
- Try different blend modes if background appears black
- Check browser console for any errors

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Code Structure

### **Core Components**

#### **Authentication (`auth-pkce.js`)**
Implements Spotify's Authorization Code Flow with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). This was necessary after Spotify deprecated the Implicit Grant Flow. The implementation:
- Generates cryptographically secure code verifiers
- Handles OAuth 2.0 flow entirely client-side
- Manages token refresh automatically
- Stores tokens securely in localStorage

#### **Main Application (`app-github.js`)**
The orchestrator that ties everything together:
- Initializes all subsystems in correct order
- Manages authentication state and UI updates
- Handles user interactions and keyboard shortcuts
- Coordinates particle system with audio analysis

#### **Particle System (`particles.js`)**
The heart of the visual experience:
- **Particle Physics**: Each particle has position, velocity, decay, and size properties
- **Bokeh Rendering**: Uses radial gradients with feathered edges for realistic blur
- **Audio Reactivity**: Particles respond to bass (movement), treble (shimmer), and overall volume
- **Emission System**: Particles emit from behind album art in controlled patterns

#### **Audio Analysis (`audioAnalyzer.js`)**
Captures and processes audio in real-time:
- **Screen Capture**: Uses `getDisplayMedia()` API to capture tab audio
- **Frequency Analysis**: Fast Fourier Transform splits audio into frequency bands
- **Level Detection**: Separate analysis for bass (20-250Hz), mids (250-2000Hz), and treble (2000-20000Hz)
- **Fallback Mode**: Synthetic audio waves when no input available

#### **Color Extraction (`colorThief.js`)**
Intelligent color palette generation:
- **K-means Clustering**: Groups similar pixels to find dominant colors
- **Smart Filtering**: Ignores pure black/white for better results
- **Dual Output**: Bright colors for particles, muted colors for background
- **Background Generation**: Creates darkened gradients (15-30% brightness) for subtle backgrounds

#### **Configuration System (`configManager.js`)**
Persistent settings management:
- **LocalStorage Backend**: Saves settings automatically
- **Export/Import**: Share configurations as JSON files
- **Default Merging**: New settings added seamlessly on updates

### **Design Decisions**

#### **Why Canvas 2D instead of WebGL?**
- Better browser compatibility
- Simpler codebase to maintain
- Sufficient performance for particle count
- Easier blend mode implementation

#### **Why Screen Capture for Audio?**
- Spotify's DRM prevents direct audio access
- Works perfectly with headphones
- Captures exact audio output
- No microphone feedback issues

#### **Why K-means for Color Extraction?**
- Finds perceptually dominant colors
- Handles gradients and complex artwork
- Fast enough for real-time updates
- Better than simple averaging

### **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Particle Pooling**: Reuses particle objects to reduce garbage collection
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Only updates changed elements
3. **RAF Throttling**: Locked to browser refresh rate
4. **Canvas Clearing**: Uses `clearRect()` instead of fillRect for transparency
5. **Batch Operations**: Groups similar draw calls

### **Security Considerations**

- **No Client Secret**: Uses PKCE flow to avoid exposing secrets
- **Token Handling**: Access tokens never logged or exposed
- **Domain Validation**: Spotify validates redirect URIs
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary scopes

## üé® Visual Design Philosophy

The visualizer aims to create an atmosphere rather than a light show. Key principles:

1. **Subtlety Over Spectacle**: Default settings favor slow, graceful movement
2. **Color Harmony**: Particles and background derive from same source
3. **Bokeh Aesthetic**: Soft, out-of-focus orbs create depth
4. **Musical Responsiveness**: React to music structure, not just volume

The particle system uses multiple blend modes:
- **Particle-to-Particle**: How particles interact with each other
- **Canvas-to-Background**: How entire particle layer blends with gradient

This dual-layer blending creates rich, complex visuals while maintaining performance.

## üôè Credits & Inspiration

- **Spotify Web API**: For providing rich music metadata
- **Web Audio API**: For making browser-based audio analysis possible
- **Processing/p5.js Community**: For particle system inspiration
- **Photography Community**: For bokeh rendering techniques

## üìù Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
- **3D Particles**: WebGL implementation for depth effects
- **Waveform Display**: Show audio waveform alongside particles
- **Preset System**: Save/share complete visual configurations
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and responsive design
- **Social Features**: Share visualizations as videos
