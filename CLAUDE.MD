i want to create a simple webpage that can display the album art from my now playing song on spotity.
The album art needs to be a square 30% the height/width (which ever is smaller) of the screen

behind the album art needs to be a particle field that responds to the local devices sound being played. the colors from the particles need to be sampled from the album art of the spotify song playing's album art

The particle effects should be smooth and water/fire like, originating from the behind the album art.
